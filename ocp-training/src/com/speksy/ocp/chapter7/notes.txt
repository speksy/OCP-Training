For Interviews, Be Familiar with Thread-Creation Options
Despite the fact that the exam no longer focuses on creating threads by extending the
Thread class and implementing the Runnable interface, it is extremely common when
interviewing for a Java development position to be asked to explain the difference
between extending the Thread class and implementing Runnable. The following are some
reasons to prefer one method over the other in Java:
■ If you need to define your own Thread rules upon which multiple tasks will rely, such
as a priority Thread, extending Thread may be preferable.
■ Since Java doesn't support multiple inheritance, extending Thread does not allow you to
extend any other class, whereas implementing Runnable lets you extend another class.
■ Implementing Runnable is often a better object-oriented design practice since it separates the task being performed from the Thread object performing it.
■ Implementing Runnable allows the class to be used by numerous Concurrency API
classes.
If asked this question, you should answer it accurately. You should also mention that you
can now use the ExecutorService, which we will discuss in the next section, to perform
thread tasks without having to create Thread objects directly.
