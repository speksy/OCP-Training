    10. The following code appears in a file named Book.java. What is the result of compiling the
    source file?

    A. The code compiles successfully, and one bytecode file is generated: Book.class.
    B. The code compiles successfully, and two bytecode files are generated: Book.class and
    BookReader.class.
    C. The code compiles successfully, and two bytecode files are generated: Book.class and
    Book$BookReader.class.
    D. A compiler error occurs on line 3.
    E. A compiler error occurs on line 5.

    Result: C. The code compiles successfully, and two bytecode files are generated: Book.class and
    Book$BookReader.class.

    C. The code compiles fine. A member inner class is allowed to be private, and it is
    allowed to refer to instance variables from the outer class. Two .class files are generated.
    Book.class matches the name of the outer class. The inner class does not compile
    to BookReader.class. That would introduce the possibility of a naming conflict.
    Book$BookReader.class is correct because it shows the scope of the class is limited to
    Book. You donâ€™t need to know that $ is the syntax, but you do need to know the number of
    classes and that BookReader is not a top-level class.
