Remember to pay attention that throw and throws arenâ€™t reversed in the
code that you see on the exam.

rules from OCA
 Java checks the catch blocks in the order in which they appear. It is illegal to declare
a subclass exception in a catch block that is lower down in the list than a superclass
exception because it will be unreachable code.

 Java will not allow you to declare a catch block for a checked exception type
that cannot potentially be thrown by the try clause body. This is again to avoid
unreachable code.

 When creating your own exception, you need to decide whether it should be a checked
or unchecked exception. While you can extend any exception class, it is most common to
extend Exception (for checked) or RuntimeException (for unchecked.)

try {
 throw new IOException();
} catch (FileNotFoundException | IOException e) { } // DOES NOT COMPILE

FileNotFoundException is subclass of IOException

In multy catch variable "e" is effectively final and cannot be reassigned!!!!!!!!!!

!!!!!!! The main difference between AutoCloseable and Closeable is that AutoCloseable has
Exception in the signature and Closeable has only IOException in the signature. Since
IllegalStateException is a runtime exception, it can be thrown by any method.
