    8. Which of the following are true of interfaces? (Choose all that apply.)

    A. They can extend other classes.
    B. They cannot be extended.
    C. They enable classes to have multiple inheritance.
    D. They can only contain abstract methods.
    E. They can be declared final.
    F. All members of an interface are public.

    Result: C) F)

    C, F. A and B are both incorrect as interfaces can extend other interfaces, although not
    classes. C is correct since a class may implement multiple interfaces. D is incorrect as interfaces
    have static and default methods, as well as static final variables. E is incorrect
    as interfaces are assumed to be abstract, and abstract and final can never be used
    together. F is correct as interface methods and variables are each assumed public.
