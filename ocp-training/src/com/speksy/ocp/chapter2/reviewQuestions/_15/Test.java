    15. Which of the following statements about polymorphism are true? (Choose all that apply.)

    A. A reference to an object may be cast to a subclass of the object without an explicit cast.
    B. If a method takes a class that is the superclass of three different object references, then
    any of those objects may be passed as a parameter to the method.
    C. A reference to an object may be cast to a superclass of the object without an explicit cast.
    D. All cast exceptions can be detected at compile time.
    E. By defining a public instance method in the superclass, you guarantee that the specific
    method will be called in the parent class at runtime.

    Results: B), C)

    B, C. A reference to an object requires an explicit cast if referenced with a subclass, so A is
    incorrect. If the cast is to a superclass reference, then an explicit cast is not required, so C is
    correct. If a method takes the superclass of an object as a parameter, then any subclass references
    may be used without a cast, so B is correct. Some cast exceptions can be detected as
    errors at compile-time, but others can only be detected at runtime, so D is incorrect. Due to
    the nature of polymorphism, a public instance method can be overridden in a subclass and
    calls to it will be replaced even in the superclass in which it was defined, so E is incorrect.
