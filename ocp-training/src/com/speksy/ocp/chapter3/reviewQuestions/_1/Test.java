    1. Suppose that you have a collection of products for sale in a database and you need to
    display those products. The products are not unique. Which of the following collections
    classes in the java.util package best suit your needs for this scenario?
    A. Arrays
    B. ArrayList
    C. HashMap
    D. HashSet
    E. LinkedList

    Result: B) ArrayList

    B. The answer needs to implement List because the scenario allows duplicates. Since you
    need a List, you can eliminate C, D, and E immediately. HashMap is a Map and HashSet is a
    Set. LinkedList is both a List and a Queue. You want a regular List. Option A, Arrays,
    is trying to distract you. It is a utility class rather than a Collection. An array is not a collection.
    By process of elimination, the answer is B.
